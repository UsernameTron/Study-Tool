<h1>Lymphatic System</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The lymphatic system is a network of vessels, organs, and tissues that help maintain fluid balance in the body and defend against infections.</p>

<h2>Key Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lymph:</strong> Clear fluid that contains white blood cells, particularly lymphocytes.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymph vessels:</strong> Network of vessels that transport lymph throughout the body.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymph nodes:</strong> Small, bean-shaped organs located along lymph vessels that filter lymph and trap pathogens.</li>
    <li><strong>Spleen:</strong> Largest lymphatic organ, filters blood and stores white blood cells.</li>
    <li><strong>Thymus:</strong> Where T cells mature, located in the upper chest.</li>
    <li><strong>Tonsils:</strong> Trap pathogens entering through the mouth and nose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Maintains fluid balance by collecting excess fluid and returning it to the bloodstream.</li>
    <li>Absorbs fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system.</li>
    <li>Defends the body against infection by producing white blood cells and antibodies.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Clinical Significance</h2>
<p>Disorders of the lymphatic system include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lymphedema:</strong> Swelling due to lymph fluid buildup.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymphadenopathy:</strong> Enlarged lymph nodes due to infection or cancer.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymphoma:</strong> Cancer of the lymphatic system.</li>
</ul>
