<h1>Lymphatic System</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The lymphatic system is a network of vessels, organs, and tissues that help maintain fluid balance in the body and defend against infections.</p>

<h2>Key Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lymph:</strong> Clear fluid that contains white blood cells, particularly lymphocytes.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymph vessels:</strong> Network of vessels that transport lymph throughout the body.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymph nodes:</strong> Small, bean-shaped organs located along lymph vessels that filter lymph and trap pathogens.</li>
    <li><strong>Spleen:</strong> Largest lymphatic organ, filters blood and stores white blood cells.</li>
    <li><strong>Thymus:</strong> Where T cells mature, located in the upper chest.</li>
    <li><strong>Tonsils:</strong> Trap pathogens entering through the mouth and nose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Maintains fluid balance by collecting excess fluid and returning it to the bloodstream.</li>
    <li>Absorbs fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system.</li>
    <li>Defends the body against infection by producing white blood cells and antibodies.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Histology</h2>
<p>Understanding the microanatomy of lymphatic tissues is crucial for comprehending their function:</p>

<h3>Lymph Node Histology</h3>
<p>Lymph nodes have a distinct capsule and are organized into:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cortex:</strong> Contains follicles with germinal centers (B cell areas)</li>
    <li><strong>Paracortex:</strong> T cell-rich area</li>
    <li><strong>Medulla:</strong> Contains medullary cords and sinuses</li>
    <li><strong>Afferent and Efferent Lymphatics:</strong> For lymph flow in and out of the node</li>
</ul>
<p>The histology slide shows these structures with germinal centers appearing as lighter-stained circular areas within the darker cortex.</p>

<h3>Thymus Histology</h3>
<p>The thymus has a distinctive lobular structure with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cortex:</strong> Dense population of developing T cells (thymocytes)</li>
    <li><strong>Medulla:</strong> Less densely populated with mature T cells</li>
    <li><strong>Hassall's Corpuscles:</strong> Distinctive whorled structures in the medulla</li>
</ul>
<p>The thymus is essential for T cell development and maturation.</p>

<h3>Spleen Histology</h3>
<p>The spleen shows a clear distinction between:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>White Pulp:</strong> Lymphoid tissue surrounding arterioles</li>
    <li><strong>Red Pulp:</strong> Blood-filled sinuses where old red blood cells are broken down</li>
    <li><strong>Marginal Zone:</strong> Transition between white and red pulp</li>
</ul>
<p>The spleen serves both immune and blood filtering functions.</p>

<h2>Clinical Significance</h2>
<p>Disorders of the lymphatic system include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lymphedema:</strong> Swelling due to lymph fluid buildup.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymphadenopathy:</strong> Enlarged lymph nodes due to infection or cancer.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymphoma:</strong> Cancer of the lymphatic system that can be identified through histological examination showing disrupted lymph node architecture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Laboratory Examination</h2>
<p>Histological samples of lymphatic tissues are typically stained with H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) to visualize cellular structures. Special stains and immunohistochemistry may be used to identify specific cell types and markers relevant to diagnosis.</p>
