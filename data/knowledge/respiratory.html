<h1>Respiratory System</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The respiratory system is responsible for gas exchange between the body and the external environment, bringing oxygen into the body and removing carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Key Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Nose and nasal cavity:</strong> Filters, warms, and humidifies air.</li>
    <li><strong>Pharynx (throat):</strong> Passageway for both air and food.</li>
    <li><strong>Larynx (voice box):</strong> Contains vocal cords and helps protect the airway.</li>
    <li><strong>Trachea (windpipe):</strong> Tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi.</li>
    <li><strong>Bronchi and bronchioles:</strong> Branches of airways that lead to the alveoli.</li>
    <li><strong>Lungs:</strong> Main organs of respiration containing alveoli where gas exchange occurs.</li>
    <li><strong>Diaphragm:</strong> Main muscle of respiration that contracts to create negative pressure in the thoracic cavity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lung Divisions</h2>
<p><strong>Right Lung:</strong> Divided into three lobes - superior, middle, and inferior.</p>
<p><strong>Left Lung:</strong> Divided into two lobes - superior and inferior (has a cardiac notch to accommodate the heart).</p>

<h2>Respiration Process</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Movement of air into and out of the lungs.</li>
    <li><strong>External respiration:</strong> Gas exchange between alveoli and pulmonary capillaries.</li>
    <li><strong>Transport:</strong> Movement of gases through the bloodstream.</li>
    <li><strong>Internal respiration:</strong> Gas exchange between systemic capillaries and tissue cells.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Clinical Significance</h2>
<p>Common respiratory conditions include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Asthma:</strong> Chronic inflammatory disease causing airway narrowing and obstruction.</li>
    <li><strong>COPD:</strong> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis.</li>
    <li><strong>Pneumonia:</strong> Infection causing inflammation of the alveoli.</li>
    <li><strong>Lung cancer:</strong> Uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lung.</li>
</ul>
